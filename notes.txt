CHARACTER TYPES:
There are several character types in Kotlin.

Numbers:
For integer numbers with no fractional part, the types are:
1. byte - smallest 
2. short 
3. int
4. long - largest

For non-integer numbers(floats) there are two data types:
1. Float
2. Double

a double is more precise that a float <<i think these are derived from 
computer representation of fractions, i.e. floating point representation
